# Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction with Python

This project predicts whether an object detected by sonar is a rock or a mine using machine learning.

# Features

Classifies sonar signals into Rock (R) or Mine (M).

Uses supervised machine learning for binary classification.

Implements data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

# Technologies Used

Python

Scikit-learn – Machine learning models

NumPy, Pandas – Data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization

# Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sonar-rock-vs-mine.git
cd sonar-rock-vs-mine


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage

Prepare the dataset (sonar.csv from UCI repository).

Train the model:

python train_model.py


Predict using new input data:

python predict.py

Dataset

Source: UCI Sonar Dataset

Contains 60 feature values per instance and a label (R or M).

Model

Logistic Regression (or alternative: SVM, Random Forest)

Trained to classify sonar signal reflections.

# Example Output

Input: Sonar signal values

Prediction: Mine

# Future Enhancements

Deploy as a web app using Flask/Streamlit.

Improve accuracy with deep learning (Neural Networks).

Add real-time signal input feature.
